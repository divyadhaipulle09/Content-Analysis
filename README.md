1	Introduction
In recent years, social media has become a powerful tool for individuals and organizations to express their opinions and share their ideas with the world, with new advancements and features being developed every day. One such development is NVIDIA's new eye contact feature, which has created quite a buzz on social media platforms like LinkedIn. This feature has captured the attention of many individuals and sparked discussions about its potential impact and usefulness. This proposed research aims to examine the comments made on Lior Sinclair’s post regarding NVIDIA's new eye contact feature on LinkedIn and classify them for a better understanding of how people are responding to this new feature.
In a report published by Elsevier  researchers discussed the facilitation of eye contact as a challenge that must be addressed so that videoconferencing can approach the rich interactions of face-to-face communication. 
2. Background & Literature
Video-mediated communication, such as videoconferencing and live streaming, has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly with the rise of remote work and the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, eye contact is an important aspect of nonverbal communication that can impact the perceived effectiveness and credibility of a video-mediated message. Eye contact has been found to increase perceived trustworthiness, attentiveness, and engagement [1].
The challenge of facilitating eye contact in video-mediated communication has been widely discussed in the literature, with various inventions proposed to address the issue, but none have found wide use [2]. This is why the recent announcement of NVIDIA's eye contact feature has created such a buzz in the technology world. This study focuses on addressing the following questions.
1.	What are the popular categories of the responses to NVIDIA's new eye contact feature on LinkedIn?
2.	What is the direction of comments made by the commentators on the need for such a feature? Are they in favor of NVIDIA’s new eye contact feature or against it on platforms such as LinkedIn?

3. Methods
This section specifically discusses the data collection and the analysis method to answer the research questions outlined above.

3.1	Data
The data for this analysis will be manually collected for 50+ comments from Lior Sinclair's post on LinkedIn regarding NVIDIA's new eye contact feature. The dataset will contain information such as the comments, and category, and in each category, the direction of comments is noted i.e., if people are against or in favor of the need for the eye contact feature. The data collection method will involve selecting a few comments from the comment section of the post randomly and selecting a few other comments that stay on the top of the comments section that has received either more votes or has been more interactive and gathered more attention from the audience. Posts that included images or GIFs with no text were excluded from the analysis. Since a negligible number of comments had hashtags, were not collected. The percentage of data points in each category will contain a diverse range of reactions to make the analysis more interesting. The time frame for the dataset will be from 20th Jan 2023 – current as it is still the latest post and has a great buzz around it on LinkedIn.

3.2 	Analysis

Using a grounded theory approach [3] posts were open-coded for topic and topic categories were narrowed through the process of axi¬¬¬al and selective coding. The comment and its category will be analyzed. What is the context of the comment?  Is the post discussing the feature in a positive or negative orientation and specifically relating to what category? Will it be a revolutionary feature for the future and enlighten the public regarding the advancements? And to the innovators will it impact the direction of invention, or will it just remain a viral post for the tollers and become a comedy or a touch of sarcasm to various other commentators? These are some of the questions that will be considered when analyzing individual posts. After the grounded theory, axial and selective coding was performed these seven major categories emerged: enlightening, curious, revolutionary, ignorant, troll, sarcastic, and witty. 

These categories were treated as mutually exclusive, where each post could be coded majorly in only one category. Definitions for each category and examples of each are enumerated in Table 1 (below).

Category	Definition	Example
Revolutionary	Comments that are breakthroughs in technology.	"Why is faking your appearance to look at the camera a good thing?"


Enlightening	Comments that provide knowledge or understanding to someone, to shed light on a situation or topic.	"Because the camera users use for video calls is rarely (never?) located at the center of their gaze. This is especially true for people with multiple monitors."


Curious	
Comments that show interest or desire to learn about or explore something.	
"Interesting! So how can AI-based recruitment systems judge whether the interviewee is looking at the camera? AI challenges AI"


Witty	Comments that are clever and humorous in a way that is expressed in speech or writing.

	"Too funny, "her eyes danced with glee". "
Sarcastic	Comments that use irony or ridicule to criticize or mock something or someone.	"OK, that's pretty cool. I am on camera A LO¬¬T and this is a real problem. Eye contact is so important when you're teaching or even just talking to someone online. I was all set to build a camera mount with 70/30 glass to accomplish this. This saves me a trip to the hardware store. Actually, no it doesn't. My wife wants a set of bookshelves. I wonder if NVidia can help me with that too?"


Trolls	Comment made by an individual who deliberately posts inflammatory or off-topic messages in an online community intending to disrupt or annoy others.	"why don‘t you just look at the camera?"
Table 1. Category definitions and examples


4	Results

The majority of comments were categorized as "revolutionary" (28%). This category accounted for the largest portion of the comments made indicating that some individuals saw the feature as a breakthrough in technology.

The categories of "enlightening" (22%) and "curious" (18%) were also found to be prevalent, indicating that the public was largely interested in learning more about the feature and its potential impact. The categories of "ignorant" (2%) and "sarcastic" (8%) were also found to be present, indicating that some individuals were skeptical or lacked understanding of the feature's capabilities, or were using the post to express humor. The categories of "troll" (6%) and "witty" (16%) were found to be present in a small number of comments, showing that some individuals were making light of the situation or making clever observations about the new feature.

5	Discussions

	Some comments suggested that the feature would enhance online communication and increase engagement in video calls, while others mentioned its potential benefits for individuals with social anxiety or those who struggle to maintain eye contact in virtual settings, helping to foster deeper connections.


5.1	Limitations & Future Directions
	This analysis are limited by the data source may not encompass the entire spectrum of opinions on the feature.
	The manual collection and categorization of comments, which was the method used in this study, is time-consuming and may be subject to human error and bias. The application of grounded theory also restricts the potential for generalizing the results to the larger public. The study also did not consider other sources of data, such as surveys, and interviews, for a comprehensive understanding of the public's response to the feature, influence of external factors, such as media coverage, on the public's perception of the feature. 

5.2	Conclusion

The majority of the respondents have stated that they are against the need for this feature. The "Revolutionary" category had the highest percentage of respondents who were against the feature, at 71.42%. The "Enlightening" category had a slightly lower percentage of respondents who were against the feature, at 54.54%. Finally, in the "Ignorant" category, 100% of the respondents were in favor of the feature.

In conclusion, most of the respondents are against the need for an eye contact feature, with only a small percentage in favor of it, a significant number of respondents couldn't say, indicating a lack of clarity about the feature.
